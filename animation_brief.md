# FuliTrack Splash Screen Animation Brief

## Project Overview
Create a modern fintech mobile app splash screen animation for FuliTrack, a Fuliza M-PESA tracking application.

## Logo Asset
- **Logo File**: `app_icon.png` (provided)
- **Logo Description**: Blue-to-green gradient "ft" lettermark in a modern, connected ribbon style

## Animation Specifications

### Concept
Transform abstract gradient light streaks into the FuliTrack logo, conveying trust, clarity, and financial professionalism.

### Animation Sequence (2.5-3 seconds total)

**Phase 1: Introduction (0.0 - 0.8s)**
- Start with soft abstract blue and green gradient light streaks
- Streaks appear on clean white background
- Gentle floating motion, establishing brand colors

**Phase 2: Formation (0.8 - 2.0s)**
- Streaks smoothly flow and merge together
- Form the connected "f" and "t" lettermark
- Fluid, ribbon-like motion (not rigid/snappy)
- Apply subtle depth during formation
- Slightly glossy, vector-clean material feel
- Add very light shadow beneath logo for depth

**Phase 3: Settle (2.0 - 2.5s)**
- Minimal settle animation (micro bounce or smooth ease-out)
- Logo floats slightly above background
- Holds steady in center

### Technical Requirements

**Format**: Lottie JSON (.json)
- Must be compatible with `lottie-flutter` package
- Vector-based, scalable
- Optimized file size (< 50KB preferred)
- 60fps smooth animation

**Dimensions**:
- Canvas: 1080x1920 (9:16 portrait)
- Logo centered, 40% of canvas height

**Colors**:
- Background: #FFFFFF (white) or very subtle off-white gradient
- Logo: Blue (#0A7EA3) to Green (#84CC16) gradient
- Keep original logo colors from provided asset

**Style**:
- Minimalist, modern UI
- Soft gradients, smooth transitions
- NO harsh effects, spinning, or "flashy" motions
- Premium, calm, trustworthy feel
- Finance/fintech appropriate

**Camera**:
- Static, centered composition
- No camera rotation or movement

### Optional Enhancements (Nice to Have)

1. **Micro Glow Pass**
   - Soft ambient glow briefly appears during logo formation
   - Fades out after logo is complete

2. **Brand Text**
   - At the end (2.5s), fade in "FuliTrack" text below logo
   - Font: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, Roboto)
   - Size: 24-28pt
   - Color: #334155 (slate gray)
   - Fade duration: 0.3s

3. **Easing**
   - Use professional easing curves (ease-out, ease-in-out)
   - Avoid linear motion

## Deliverables

1. **Lottie JSON file** (`fulitrack_splash.json`)
2. **Preview MP4** for approval (1080x1920, 60fps)
3. **Source file** (After Effects project with Bodymovin plugin)

## Reference Style

**Similar Animations** (for inspiration only):
- Revolut app splash (premium fintech feel)
- Stripe mobile onboarding (smooth, professional)
- Calm app intro (gentle, trustworthy)

**Mood**:
- Professional, not playful
- Trustworthy, not flashy
- Modern, not trendy
- Smooth, not fast

## Budget & Timeline

- **Budget**: $50-150 USD (depending on complexity)
- **Timeline**: 3-5 days preferred
- **Revisions**: 2 rounds included
